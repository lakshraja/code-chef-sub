This Project is a submission for the task for code-chef club recruitment at vit 2025-26

It is a bare minimum notes app. It is made using python3, sqlite3 (db) and tkinter (ui)

## Features:
Create Notes: You can create a new note by clicking the '+' button on the main page
Saving notes: Closing the app or pressing the back button will automatically save the note
Editing notes: Created notes can be accessed by clicking and edited as per wish
Deleting notes: Pressing the 'x' button on top of any note will delete the note permanently

## Tech Stack Used
python3 - core programming language used
tkinter - default python gui framework
sqlite3 - for database management

## Problems and Scalability
Althoght the problem statement had more features, due to time constraint and college work, i couldn't finish it in time. But the app is 'scalable enough' (not ultra scalable/perfect) to make those changes if given time. In fact, i have left comments or gaps in some places where one is supposed to implement the other features.

The app design may not seem practical at times but the time contraint demanded me to choose impractical designs

## Running:
To run the app, check if you have all the required packages, most of the packages required are mostly built in python and hence i dont include a requirements.txt file
After checking the availability of the requirements, just run - python3 main.py    in the app directory in your shell
